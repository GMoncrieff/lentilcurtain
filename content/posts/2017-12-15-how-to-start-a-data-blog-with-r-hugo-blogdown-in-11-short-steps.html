<p>I just finished creating this blog to share stories, teach R skills, create environmental data stories, and most importantly - shamelesly self-promote. It makes sense to share with you a minimal formula for starting your own data blog with R.</p>
<p>Yihui Xie, the master behind Rmarkdown, has kindly created a great framework for blogging with R - blogdown. Blogdown creates Hugo (one of the most popular open-source static site generators) websites, and allows you to write new content using markdown or Rmarkdown. This makes it really easy to create posts sharing R code and workflows. He has created a great, comprehensive guide available <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here</a>. But the process is so simple you can achieve it in 10 simple steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a new project in Rstudio in a new folder</p></li>
<li><p>Install the blogdown package</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install Hugo (from within R)</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code></pre>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Choose a theme for your blog from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" class="uri">https://themes.gohugo.io/</a> - beware not all of them have been tested with blogdown</p></li>
<li><p>Create your new site from this template. The string we use for the theme is the github site where the theme is hosted. The example below uses the hugo-academic theme hosted at <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic" class="uri">https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic</a></p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;gcushen/hugo-academic&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This will automatically download all the files for your site into your project folder. You can now start editing these files to customise your site.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Edit the <code>config.toml</code> file to change theme settings and general paramters of your site such as author, site description etc</li>
<li>Add images that you will use to the folder <code>static/images</code> in your project home directory</li>
<li>Edit your sites content by editing the pages within the <code>content</code> folder in your project home directory. Here you can add new blog posts, or editing existing content</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can also add new blog posts using the handy Rstudio addin that comes with blogdown, just click <code>Tools &gt; Addins &gt; Browse Addins</code> and select <code>New Post</code>. You can specify the post title, dates, tags and categories using this tool.<br />
The same functionality can be acheived using a blogdown function:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_post()</code></pre>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Now you have a website, you probably want to share it with others. First create a repo on github for your website. Then initialize your project folder and push it to that repo. After navigating to your project directory:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="bash"><code>git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/repo_name.git
git add .
git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;
git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>You will want to create a <code>.gitgnore</code> to prevent unessasary files from being pushed to git. An example <code>.gitignore</code> would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>public/<br />
<em>.Rproj<br />
</em>.Rhistory<br />
.Rproj.user/</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create an account at <a href="http://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, itâ€™s free. Choose the option to create a new site from git, and after loggining into your github account select the repository containing your website. When prompted, choose to deploy the master branch, and type <code>hugo</code> for build command and <code>public</code> for publish directory. This should start the deploy of your website. If all goes well, you should get a link to your new site and <em>viola</em> your website is live</p></li>
<li><p>Pat yourself on the back</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Making updates and new posts to your site is as simply as making the change or adding the post locally in your R project, and pushing the changes to github. Netlify will automatically rebuild the website whenever you update the repo</p>
